In January 2015 a friend and I drove from Nuremberg, Germany to Mali on our motorcycles. We spent some time in Morocco, before we headed further down through Mauretania, Senegal and on to Mali.
You can take a look at our [route](/west-africa-2015/route/) for more details.
The whole journey took a little over 4 months.
We travelled on two Honda Transalp, 23 and 17 years old.
If you're interested in what equipment we used, take a look at our [packing list](/west-africa-2015/packing-list).
