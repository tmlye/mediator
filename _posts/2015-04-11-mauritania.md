Today is border crossing day, so we get up quite early and pack our bags accordingly.
With all documents easy to reach, we say goodbye to the Austrian family and get in line behind the other cars at the gate.
The moroccan side is quick and easy, one stamp in our passport for us, stamps for the motorcycle, one guy checking the papers and the gendarmerie writing our name in a book.
When exiting Morocco, we have to cross a few kilometers of piste to reach the Mauritanian side.
I don't know why this strip of empty land exists between the borders, but there are still active landmines buried nearby, it's full of broken vehicles and money changers.
We don't leave the well laid out tracks through the sand and make it to the other side without problems.

Reaching the other side, we first check in at the police, then get our visa.
As we learned yesterday, the price was increased from 50eur to 120eur. Crazy.
It is advisable to get the visa for Mauritania in Rabat, where it's only around 35eur, but we learned of the change too late.
Next stop is the customs office, their connection is not working, so they're not open yet.
We get our police stamp and order the insurance while we wait.
After 4 hours they finally open.
They ask for 50eur per motorcycle for a passavant, but we negotiate them down to 30eur.
On paper the passavant costs 10eur, but everyone seems to be in on this corrupt game, even the big boss.
We don't think it's productive to argue with them, because that would mean that we probably won't leave this border today.
With the customs done, we can finally enter Mauritania, pick up the insurance (10days = 9eur) and drive south.

The road to Nouakchott is in good condition, straight and with only a few villages on the way.
It leads by dunes half covering the road and through endless plains of wind compressed sand.
The landscape has a much greater desert feel to it than Western Sahara.
Hot, sand-ladden winds coming from the east first make driving exhausting.
They turn after a while and with the wind at our back, we drive a few hundred kilometers before we set up camp.

On the next day, we reach Nouakchott and stay at Auberge Menata, a small oasis in the midst of the noisy, dusty city.

Our plan is to drive from Mauritania directly to Mali on the route de l'espoir, so we visit the Mali embassy.
The staff gives us a form to fill out, which we do on his messy desk, in the midst of all kinds of personal papers.
He leaves the room. I guess we look trustworthy.

When he sees which point of entry we chose, he tells us he's not going to give us a visa.
It's too dangerous for a "red man and white man".
We argue that two weeks ago a German crossed the border there, but he doesn't want to change his mind.
No visa. He tells us to go to Senegal.
Okay, fine.
We drive to the Senegalese embassy, where they don't even let us in because their system doesn't work.
With our mood at a low point we go back to the auberge.
For Senegal, you can apply and pay for a visa online, which we do.
The next thing we want to get is a carte brune for our motorcycles.
It's an insurance that works in many West African countries.
We drive from insurance bureau to insurance bureau, but none of them have it.
After about 8 bureaus we give up and go back.
Another day wasted on bureaucracy.
In the late afternoon, two French guys manage to get the carte brune and tell us which of the hundreds of insurance offices in this city has it.
It's called MAR Assurance.
We get ours too and are finally (after 3 days) ready to go.
The next day we head south towards the worst border in West Africa: Rosso.
There are two border crossings into Senegal from Mauritania, one is Rosso and one is Diama.
Diama is better than Rosso in general, but they don't have any visa machines, which means if you only have the online visa, you have to go to Rosso. At least so we thought.
We later learned that it's possible in Diama, too, but you have to go to the Saint Louis airport afterwards.
Starting in May, Europeans don't need a visa for Senegal any more, so it won't matter then.

The road to Rosso is full of potholes, but in general okay to drive.
Hot wind is blowing from the Sahara.
It's crazy hot.
We estimate that in the sun, which is everywhere because there's no shade, it's 45Â°C.
Even at 110km/h the heat is unbearable.
It feels like someone is holding a giant hair dryer in front of your face.
My lips become as dry as sand.
For the first time on this trip, I really wish I had a car.
Lorenz doesn't take the heat well.
When we reach Rosso, he's completely exhausted, so we spend the night camping.
An old man is guarding a nearby house.
He doesn't speak French and offers us his seat.
After we rest for a while in the shade, he brings us food and water.
A thin mat is brought for us to rest on after we finish eating.
Using my without-words-dictionary, we ask him if it's okay to camp here.
He says yes.
In the evening he brings us more food, when I pay him he asks "pourquoi?". 
I explain that it's for food and drink and he accepts, laughing and shaking his head.
I doubt that he would have ever asked for money.

We sleep early and get up early to beat the midday heat.
It's around 8:30am when we enter the Mauritanian side of the Rosso border.
The whole procedure has 4 steps.
The first one is getting our passports stamped.
For us this was free, but we read online that it normally costs 500MRO.
You get a small white paper in return which you need in order to get on the ferry.
Next we need to get our motorcycles out, so we go to the customs office on the first floor.
They charge us 4000MRO per bike.
A decent price.
Next we need a ferry ticket, which is sold near the entrance gate for 5000MRO.
We also need to pay community tax, 2000MRO.
With all four tickets, we can now enter the ferry and go to "the next level" - the Senegalese side.

A policeman on the ferry collects passport, driver's license and motorcycle papers.
After we park the bikes, we go to pick up our papers and get our visa done.
With the visa in the passport we have to get it stamped.
All this was free, so far so good.
Next step is customs, he charges us 5000CFA each instead of 2500CFA, because it's Saturday.
Of course he just wants to make some money, but it's a reasonable amount - not worth picking a fight over.
We pay 1000CFA each for parking and 4000CFA for the fixer.
After the gate we come to a customs post where we have to get our passavant stamped.
They charge 1000CFA for this, which we think is bullshit, but whatever.
Not worth the fight.
By staying polite and cleverly evading the higher charges, we got through this nightmare of a border quite well.
If you fight back, you won't make any friends here.
It's better to hold back your pride and accept that they have the upper hand.
They tried to charge us 62500CFA for the passavant, but we simply said that we don't have that much money and no bank card.
We pretended we get our money with Western Union, and all of the sudden we didn't have to pay.
Overall we each payed 50eur and spend around 3h there.
Not bad.
We reach Saint Louis in the evening.
A familiar face is there, too: Karl from Iceland, who we met at Auberge Menata.
We go out together to have some pizza and beers.
The first ones in a long time.
