On our way to Cubelles, we stop in Vilanova, where we visit a Honda dealer. The guy is not very helpful and doesn't seem to want to order the part we need to fix Lorenz' speedometer; he claims that it will take 3 days to send the part from Barcelona, ridiculous. We drive 2mins to [Mad-Gas Motos][madgas], where a very friendly employee orders the part for tomorrow morning, 11 o'clock for the same price, great! We also buy a new mirror, since one of mine broke. Our host in Cubelles, Meritxell, welcomes us into our her home and our motorcycles into her family's garage. The garage (like her apartment) is spacious and we spend the whole next day doing repairs/maintenence, while she is at work. Lorenz picks up the spare part and fixes his speedometer, while I start to take the rear wheel, the swingarm and the front sprocket off in order to replace the chain and sprockets. The chain and sprockets were already worn when we started this trip, so we brought a new set with us. I was hoping the old one would last a bit longer, though. We fit the new sprockets and reinstall the swingarm. , the only problem we have now is that the new chain is not an endless chain, so we need a chain riveting tool to safely fit the two ends together. So I drive back to [Mad-Gas Motos][madgas] and with the help of pictures and Google Translate manage to convince the owner of the shop to lend the tool to me, excellent! With the help of tool we manage to combine the two loose ends. Finally finished at 7:30 and even got the tool back in time before they close the shop.

We eat dinner with Meritxell, talk for long and try to play Durak, a Russian. card game, but we can't get the rules right, even with the help of Wikipedia. Well, it's fun anyways. The next day, we visit a Buddhist monastery together with Meritxell and her brother. Afterwards, we walk around Sitges, a pretty town on the seaside, eat lunch and take a walk along the beach in sunny but windy weather; we had a wonderful day, thank you Meritxell!

The next day, we leave Cubelles behind and head south to Castello de la Plana. Along the way we stop at the Ebro delta and manage to find Flamingos. They're quite far away, so we have to photograph them using our binoculars as a lens.

In Castello, Maria welcomes us into her home. We walk around the city together and eat Churros, fried sticks made of flour, which are dipped in thick hot chocolate (I forgot to take a photo, sorry). Back at Maria's house, we have dinner and eat some of her grandfather's delicious mandarin oranges. We spend the next two days on the road, fighting the never ending wind. At windspeeds which would be considered a storm in Germany, riding is exhausting. You constantly have to lean into the wind and concentrate so it doesn't blow you out of your lane. We reach Almeria, where we stay with my father's colleague's family, who generously offered to host us for a few days. His son, Darius, shows us around the city. The next 2 days are uneventful: we wait for a spare part Lorenz ordered to finally fix his speedometer, which broke again on the way to Almeria. We use the waiting time to try to figure out how to get the bikes back from Africa to Europe. Flying them back seems like the best and cheapest option, so we'll check at the airport in Fez (Morocco), to see if Royal Air Maroc has cargo flights from somewhere in or around Burkina Faso.

Thanks to Darius' mother we leave Almeria well fed and head to Granada, where we spend a full day sightseeing. The Alhambra, a large area with old buildings and nice gardens is definitely worth seeing. The moorish style palace is among the most impressive buildings I've seen so far. Its walls are decorated with insanely detailed patterns made mostly of carved plaster (yeseria) and tiles. The yeseria is hard to capture in pictures, because the closer you get to it, the more details you discover, but you have to sacrifice the ability to see it as a whole, which provides yet another, completely different viewpoint. We can't help but wonder how many years it must have taken to complete these patterns. The rest of day, we stroll around the many tiny streets in Granada's old town.

The next day we drive to Motril alongside the Sierra Nevada, which provides stunning views on an otherwise boring road. In Motril we board a ferry to Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Morocco.

Leaving Europe behind feels good; it's nice for a while, but the lack of adventure and the similar basic spirit of the countries bore us too quickly. It's time for something new.
