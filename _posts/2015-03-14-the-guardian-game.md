The last week was a quiet one.
After we dropped off Nina at the airport, we spent 5 nights at a recreational area near Marrakech.
On the fourth day, we pick up Katherine, my girlfriend, from the airport.
She will travel with us for two weeks.
We spend much of the free time reading and updating our blogs.
I've created and added a map which shows our route.
You can take a look at it [here][/route].

Our next stop is Sidi Kaouki, a quiet surfer town on the coast.
We arrive in the afternoon and find a nice place to stay.
It even has a usable kitchen.
The next day we head to Essaouira, a beautiful coastal town with a large harbor and a nice medina.
We drink some fresh orange juice, visit the harbor and take a stroll through the medina.
The town seems to be used to tourists, yet we're not being annoyed by faux guides at all.

Going back to our bikes, the guardian sees us and comes over to chat with us while we put on our equipment.
He's not doing that because he loves talking to tourists, but because he wants to make sure we don't drive away without paying.
In Morocco, in every town, on every parking lot that can hold more than a few cars, there is a so-called guardian.
This guardian claims to watch over your vehicle for a small fee.
To make him look more like an authoritive figure, he wears a neon vest.
How the town chooses a guardian for a certain parking lot is unknown.
As far as we know, some guy just buys a neon vest and claims to be the chosen one.
Since we first encountered them, we've been very sceptical of these people and the whole process surrounding them.
Most of them will try to tell you where to park, solely based on minimizing the distance they have to walk.
This is something that can be easily ignored.
What we cannot ignore is the ridiculousness of their job.
If it's a busy parking lot, the only thing the guardian will watch out for is who's currently leaving, so he can collect his money.
If it's a small parking lot, the typical guardian will spend his time drinking tea and chatting with other unemployed people.
Watching over your vehicle (reminder: that is what you're paying for), is one of the last things on his mind.
So not only are you giving a guy money for something you didn't even want or need, he's also not even going to do the thing you didn't want or need.
Paying them is also not a voluntary act.
Since we don't like to pay people who sit around and do nothing all day for things we don't want or need, we've made it our personal hobby to get away without paying.
On this particular day we asked the guide to present the official rates to us in writing.
Of course he cannot do that, because there is no such thing as official rates.
He keeps asking for his money and we keep asking for the rates.
After a while he gets angry and calls over his colleagues.
Pretty soon there's around 5 people yelling at us.
One of them is especially angry and kicks one of my aluminum boxes.
Noticing that his foot is not strong enough, he goes and picks up a stone.
I threaten to call the police.
He drops the stone.
Before it gets any worse, we give the guardian his money.
At least he earned it this time, although certainly not by doing what we payed him for.
What's strange is that the whole country seems to conspire to keep this idiotic practice going.
So maybe there is something we're missing.
I still don't think that the city (who built the parking lot) sees a single cent of that money.

The next day we visit some sand dunes and cascades near Sidi Kaouki.
The cascades don't have much water and are therefore quite boring.
The surroundings are beautiful nonetheless.
