After visiting the gorge, we head south to Tizi-N-Tazazert, a mountain pass.
You can imagine Tizi-N-Tazazert as a dirt road over a mountain.
A very scenic dirt road.
The way up consists of a normal gravel road which turns into a small piste, just big enough for one car.
The piste is still muddy at times from the snow melting around us.
I drop the bike a few times. Besides some dents in the boxes, there is no damage.
We camp near the highest spot.
It gets cold at night, but still above 0, so we're fine.
Except for a cyclist from Austria, we don't meet a single person on the way up.
The next morning, before we even have breakfast, we see two people on a moped approach.
Wondering what they want from us we watch them approach.
It's a man and a woman and the closer they get the more sure we are that they want to sell something.
The man speaks little English.
He does all the talking: the usual questions.
After a while the woman starts unwrapping her souvenir store.
We politely tell them that we don't need anything.
All the usual sentences (see the previous post) don't get them to leave.
They watch us while we pack up our stuff.
The minutes pass and we try to get them to leave using more aggressive language.
They persist. We shout at them.
They shout back. Finally they grab their mobile souvenir shop and leave.
We wonder why they never leave us alone.
Since we entered "berber territory", we haven't been able to sit anywhere without some guy trying to sell us useless things.
Apparently this isn't even possible on 2100m above sea level, on a mountain pass only reachable by the worst kind of road.
Not even here, in the middle of nowhere, can a we eat our breakfast in peace.
The mentality of the Berber people is getting on our nerves and we hope it will get better soon.
Inshallah it will.
