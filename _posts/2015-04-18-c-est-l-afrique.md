We spend our day in Saint Louis walking through the old colonial part of town.
The houses are in surprisingly good shape and beautifully painted.


The next morning we leave our campsite.
It is located on the outermost island of Saint Louis, where all the fishing boats lie and arrive.
It's very busy during the day.
Trucks are lined up on the road to buy the freshly caught fish.
Most of them stay for a few days until they're full, before they travel as far as Mali to sell their cargo.
There's also women carrying buckets on their head, presumably with fish inside.
There's goats walking around and horse carriages on the road.

We only drive a few kilometers south of Saint Louis to a German run campsite called [7 Palava](http://7palava.com).
The campsite is lovely and was built with attention to detail.
It's delightful to use bathroom doors which can be closed and locked without any kind of force.
On this trip, I've spent at least half an hour of my life fighting with ill constructed doors.
Very few doors have worked flawlessly, probably less than 2%.
The worst was in Sidi Kaouki.
Our room door was of the metal bolt kind.
In theory, the door is opened and closed by moving the bolt out of and into a hole in the door frame.
In this particular case, the bolt was rusty and slightly too large for it's slider and the hole.
Opening the door from the outside would result in 30s of screeching noise while you slowly moved the bolt out of the frame with a good amount of force.
After that it was possible to open the door by about 20 degrees before it would scrape along the floor.
This meant you had to push against it with almost all your body weight if you wanted it to open further.
Once you were inside the room, you had to do the same thing again to shut it.
Then you had to use the metal bolt on the inside to keep the door from opening by 20 degrees.
Of course this bolt was also too large for its hole, which meant a bit more fiddling before you finally completed a task that shouldn't require more than 2 seconds.
(reminder: we're just trying to enter a room here and close the door behind us)

Anyways, back to Saint Louis.
We like the campsite, so we stay a few nights here.
Well rested, we continue south-east.
When we reach Kaffrine, the first hotel tells us they are fully booked, even though I can clearly see the keys hanging on the board.
There's also only one car outside.
Maybe they don't like us, so we ask where another hotel is.
It's the same story at the next one.
Maybe it's a scam, so I ask a random guy on the street in another part of town.
He knows a hotel and tells us the way.
The guy at the reception finally tells us what's going on.
The president is in town and booked every room in all the hotels for 4 days straight.
What a nightmare.
It was already dark when we reached Kaffrine, so continuing was out of the question.
We ask him if it's possible to pitch our tent in the garden.
"C'est possible".
We're not in the mood for camping after driving in the heat all day, so we go to eat first and look for other options on the way.
The guy filling our tanks at the gas station knows an auberge run by some Europeans, wonderful.
We drive through unlit, dusty alleys for a while, only to discover that it's closed.
I almost fall asleep at the eating place.
We ask them if they know where we can stay, but they don't know either.
Is there no teranga in this city?
We go back to the hotel that offered us to camp in the garden.
The receptionist says he talked to the security boss of the president and it's not allowed to camp here.
A friend of his is willing to let us stay in his yard.
When we get there, we're too tired to set up the tent and since there's no mosquitoes, we just sleep outside.
Our host is a sous verre artist and shows us some photos of his work.
It's beautiful. You can read about this art form [here](http://www.au-senegal.com/les-peintures-sous-verre-art-populaire-du-senegal,066.html?lang=fr).
He didn't ask, but we still give him some money for letting us stay.
In exchange he gives us some small pieces of sous verre he made.

On a very good road, we continue to Tambacounda.
The president seems to be going there, too.
Along the road, around every 300 meters or so, there is a policeman posted.
All of them carry automatic rifles.
This idiotic waste of tax money continues for the whole 215km.

We arrive in Tambacounda around midday - time to find a shelter from the blistering heat.
In a bar, we have some cold water, while the people around us drink beer.
I don't know how they can do it.
A guy comes in, buys two cans for takeaway and approaches us.
He's figured that the bikes outside are ours.
We talk to him for a while: he's an air traffic controller at the nearby airport and glad to practice his English.
He offers us to come to his house.
A few hours with air-conditioning certainly don't hurt and he seems like a good guy - we accept.
For Senegalese standards he is wealthy.
Only few people in this country can afford their own air-conditioned apartment.
We get along well with Mustafa and end up staying the night.
With the president in town, we probably wouldn't have been able to get a room anyways.

The next day, we drive to a camp next to the Gambia river, on the edge of the Niokolo-Koba National Park.
It's quite large and touristic, but well made.
We're the only people there.
The view over the river is excellent.
We sit down next to a giant tree to survey the surroundings.
From time to time we can spot different animals with the binoculars.
There's countless of birds, but one them sticks out: a rather large white eagle.
He's not close enough, so we have to use the binoculars as a lens again.


Every few minutes or so a hippo's head emerges out of the water, does a few breaths and disappears again.
In the afternoon, a horde of monkeys takes a bath in the river.
We do a boat tour in the evening.
For a cheap price we get closer to the monkeys(baboons), see antilopes, lizards and a lot of birds.
It's still hot outside, so the hippos decide to stay in the water.
I would do the same if I were a hippo.
With nightfall we can hear and see the baboons climbing into the trees to sleep.
