After visiting the gorge, we head south to Tizi-N-Tazazert, a mountain pass.
You can imagine Tizi-N-Tazazert as a dirt road over a mountain.
A very scenic dirt road.
The way up consists of a normal gravel road which turns into a small piste, just big enough for one car.
The piste is still muddy at times from the snow melting around us.
I drop the bike a few times. Besides some dents in the boxes, there is no damage.
We camp near the highest spot.
It gets cold at night, but still above 0, so we're fine.
Except for a cyclist from Austria, we don't meet a single person on the way up.

The next morning, before we even have breakfast, we see two people on a moped approach.
Wondering what they want from us we watch them carefully.
It's a man and a woman. The closer they get the more sure we are that they want to sell something.
The man speaks little English.
He does all the talking: the usual questions.
After a while the woman starts unwrapping her souvenir store.
We politely tell them that we don't need anything.
All the usual sentences (see the previous post) don't get them to leave.
They watch us while we pack up our stuff.
The minutes pass and we try to get them to leave using more aggressive language.
They persist. We shout at them.
They shout back. Finally they grab their mobile souvenir shop and leave.
We wonder why they never leave us alone.
Since we entered "berber territory", we haven't been able to sit anywhere without some guy trying to sell us useless things.
Apparently this isn't even possible on 2300m above sea level, on a mountain pass only reachable by the worst kind of road.
Not even here, in the middle of nowhere, can we eat our breakfast in peace.
The mentality of the Berber people is getting on our nerves and we hope it will get better soon.
Inshallah it will.

Once we reach the end of the piste, we head towards the desert.
While the landscape is getting dryer and dryer, the contrast between the oases near the rivers and the rest of the land is getting bigger.
We stop at a campsite in one of the oases.
The owner invites us to tea and dates.
They're delicious.

Near the beginning of the desert, we find a nice "campsite" where we spend one night.
The next day we take a Toyota Landcruiser to Erg Chegaga, a place where high dunes live.
We also ride dromedars there, which is interesting and fun for a while.
I prefer my motorcycle, though.
It behaves less like a ship, is under my control and a lot less smelly.
Nevertheless, seeing how well adjusted this animal is to its harsh environment is astonishing.

After the desert, we head towards Marrakech.
We stop on the way to look at stone carvings.
They were made during a time when elephants, antilopes and lions still lived in Morocco.
Our next stop is Ouarzazate, where we visit a Kasbah.
It's empty on the inside, but the outside is a pleasant sight.

The way to Marrakech continues over the Atlas mountains on a surprisingly narrow road, considering that this is one of the main roads connecting the coastal region with the eastern part of Morocco.
The mountain pass is scenic and fun to drive.
I record a lot of it, but haven't uploaded the footage, yet.

We reach Marrakesh and are immediately drawn into the chaos.
Our hotel is in the medina and claims to have private parking on their website.
We reach it only by small alleys through which our motorcycles barely fit.
Finding our way through the alleys, between people, donkeys, carts and markets is stressful.
When we we reach the hotel and find out that there's no private parking, we're angry.
We don't feel like parking the motorcycle on a parking spot about 500m away, so we empty the boxes and leave them in the alley in front of our hotel.
The next thing we find out is that the city tax is 4eur per night.
In a country where you can live comfortably on 10-15eur per day, that's a lot.
Not a good start for Marrakech.
In the evening we stroll through the medina to the big plaza.
They sell many types of foods there, fresh orange juice and snacks.
The atmosphere is great.
There's music and street performers.
The next day we bring Nina to the airport, from which she'll fly back to Germany.
