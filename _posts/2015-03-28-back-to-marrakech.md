We spend the night in Tafraoute.
The next day is sunny, so we head out to look at the painted rocks near Tafraoute.
A Belgian artist used 18 tons of paint to paint multiple rock formations in various colors.
The idea seems idiotic at best, but the result is still strangely beautiful to look at.

From Tafraoute we continue towards Taroudant.
On the way, we visit the Agadir Tasguent.
An Agadir is a fortified, castle-like structure where the nomadic families stored supplies for the winter.
The Agadir Tasguent is 900 years old and inhabited by a family which takes care of it.
We arrive there in the early afternoon without having eaten lunch before.
The guardian is a middle-aged man who has slightly crippled legs, but is able to walk.
He introduces his mother to us.
For Moroccan standards she is crazy old or at least looks like it.
According to the CIA world factbook, only around 5% of Moroccans are 65 or older.
They don't speak French.
He offers us something to eat.
Since we're hungry, we accept.
Wondering what he's going to offer us, we enter his house.
The room he shows us is empty except for a thin mat and a tiny table.
He brings out an onion, a can of sardines and a loaf of bread.
They must be very poor.
In Muslim culture, a guest of the house is always offered the best they have.
If this is the best thing they have in the house, I wonder what they usually eat.
This also explains why their home is so empty.
They can't afford furniture.
After the meal he accompanies us to the Agadir.
The father of the family who lives in it gives us a tour.
There's an overall of 366 little storage rooms, spread out over different parts of the complex.
The ones higher up are reached by steps of rock sticking out of the wall.
He also takes us to the roof, from which we have a great view of the surrounding area.

Returning to our motorcycles, the guardian doesn't ask us for money, but we still pay him very well.
He clearly needs it.
We continue towards Irherm through beautiful landscape.

Irherm is a rather unpleasant town, the hotels and food are bad, but it's getting dark, so we spend the night.
We're delighted to reach Taroudant and find a nice hotel within our budget.
The city's flair is great, there's an unusual variety of food, a big market and the mountains provide a beautiful backdrop.
We spend three nights here, just walking around in this city is fun.
We're glad to be able to eat all the food that is not available in smaller Moroccan towns:
Pizza, Panini, French fries and salad.
Definitely my favorite city in Morocco.

After Taroudant we drive to Marrakech over the Tizi-N-Test, a mountain pass through the high Atlas.
This is the best road we took so far in Morocco.
Stunning landscape, curvy, narrow, but with good tarmac most of the time.
Perfect for motorcycles.
We stop to visit an old mosque in "all natural colors", as the mandatory guide likes to emphasize.
The mosque is no longer used.
Otherwise we wouldn't be able to visit - entering mosques is forbidden for non-Muslims in Morocco.

Marrakech greets us with it's usual busy atmosphere.
We find a hotel in Gueliz, the modern center of Marrakech.
By bus, we go to Jamaa el Fna, the main square which boasts many food stalls at night.
There's a lot of stalls, but in reality the variety is not that great, because the stalls copy each other (as usual in Morocco).
We have dinner here. 
As we arrived quite late, head back to the hotel.
The next day we visit the Menara Gardens and take a walk around the Medina.
We try to find a shop to buy new wheel bearings and grease, but the shop is closed because it's Friday.
There's a shopping mall in Gueliz with a food court.
We head there to eat some Asian style noodles.
The udon I order aren't really udon, but it's delicious nonetheless.
In the morning, I have to say goodbye to Katherine and bring her to the airport.
Lorenz and I start our long way south towards Mauritania.
