After Sidi Kaouki, we head to Imsouane, another surfer town.
Finding affordable accommodation here takes longer than expected, so we head to the small cliffs first to watch the giant waves crash down on them.
The view is stunning. 
The never ending waves hitting the cliffs with great force shoots water high up into the air.
We watch this spectacle for a while, shoot some videos and take pictures.

The next day we head into the mountains, towards Imouzzer.
The valley we're driving through is called Paradise Valley.
It used to be a popular destination for hippies.
We don't see any hippies, but can understand why they came here.
It's a beautiful place.
As we drive further up the mountain, noise seems to be coming from my rear wheel.
We stop to check the chain and the wheel, but can't find anything obvious.
The noise didn't magically disappear over night, so we check it again in the morning.
We still can't find anything obvious, but remember that the wheel bearing hasn't been in a good shape for a while now.
We brought new ones with us, but decide that this remote mountain pass with the traffic density of one car per 15 minutes is probably not a good place to change it.
Especially because we have no hammer and no tool to properly remove the old and fit the new one.
So we continue to Imouzzer, where the supposedly greatest cascades of North Africa can be seen.
When we get there, we are met by the same disappointing view as the last time.
There's not enough water.
Only a small part of the cascades is "working".
There's a beautiful cave-like structure below the cascades, which makes up for it.

The road continues further through the mountains, first up again over a pass, then back down into a valley and up again until we reach the N8.
We reach Agadir and head towards the East in the direction of Tafraoute.
After a while the behavior of the rear wheel gets worse, it now noticeably moves while driving.
Slowly but steadily we reach the next town.
Rain is pouring down. We're freezing.
The only hotel in town is quickly found.
The negotiations take a while, though.
I get up early the next morning to take the wheel off.
The balls of the wheel bearing fall out as I do so.
There's not much left of the grease seal either, it simply got shredded.
Should have replaced the bearing earlier.
We walk around the town to the various stores which might have a seal in the right size.
After a while we manage to find it.
Now we need a mechanic.
A guy in the store offers to bring us to one.
He doesn't seem the faux guide type, so we follow him.
The mechanic works fast, he's obviously done this a few times before.
In the end, he asks only for 20DH.

With the wheel back on the bike we continue further to Tafraoute.
It's cold and rains on and off.
Not a pleasant weather to drive in.
