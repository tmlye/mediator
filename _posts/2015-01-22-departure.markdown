After months of not-so-intense preparation, the week leading up to our departure was filled with preparing for this trip. Packing and organizing a few more items that we needed took longer than we had expected, but we finally left on Sunday morning, a relatively sunny day.

Our motorcycles, two Honda Transalp, are not too heavily packed, we attached three aluminium cases and use a tank bag to transport our equipment. I believe we found a good mix between being prepared for everything and traveling as light as possible. We leave around 11, taking the German Autobahn steadily west towards Karlsruhe  and then south, along the Rhine towards Freiburg. We have to stop every 50kms or so to reanimate our fingers and warm ourselves in the gas station. On the second stop I decide to put on another pair of gloves underneath my bigger ones, but it doesn't help -  the fingers still go numb after a while. We keep this rhythm for the whole way to Freiburg, 30 minutes of cold -  20 minutes of warmth. In the early evening we arrive at Megan's house, where we will spend the night. She is a couchsurfer and lives there with her parents. It's a very cosy, some 300-400 year old house, made almost completely out of wood. She made quiche for dinner and we talk for some time before we head to bed.

We eat breakfast while snow passes by the window. Luckily it's too "warm", so it melts when it hits the ground. We want to reach the south of France as fast as possible, so we say our goodbyes and hit the road. On the way to our next host near Dole, we visit Colmar, a nice old town with some nice old houses. Our host today is actually a family with 2 daughters who draw us cute pictures and wrap them as presents while the mother just doesn't stop talking.

We've decided to reduce the kilometers we drive per day and stay in the cheapest hotel the next day before we head further to Valence. By now I'm used to the feeling of my fingers going numb, my neck becoming a block of ice and the icy wind hitting my face, so it's a bit less painful to reach the hotel. The next day we drive mostly along the Rhone, first through light rain, then snow and then more rain. The snow is the worst as you constantly have to wipe it of your "windshield" (goggles in my case). Soaking wet and cold we reach the house of François, who speaks fluent German, and his housemates. We warm ourselves near the warm fireplace in the otherwise cold house. Later, we cook potato casserole (gratin) and a cake called gallette des rois, which is eaten in France during January. A small figure is hidden inside the cake and whoever gets the piece with it hidden inside becomes the king for the day. To ensure fair chances for everyone, the youngest usually has to crawl underneath the table and name the person who will receive the piece currently being distributed. We skip that part, though. With our bellies full, it doesn't take long until we fall asleep, while outside the rain still hasn't stopped.
