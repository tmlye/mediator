From Marrakech it's about 1700km to the border of Mauritania.
Only the first 400 or so are through relatively normal, settled land.
The rest is mostly empty.
We leave Marrakech quite late, as we bought some supplies.
The highway to Agadir is not cheap, but quick.
I enjoy the feeling of making progress.
After quite some time, we're finally moving towards a new country, new landscapes and a new climate.
Morocco has become too familiar to us and it's starting to get boring.
After spending the day driving, we reach Tiznit.
It's a small town.
Typical moroccan style, but with a nice southern flair.
It's noticeably warmer here.
In the morning, we print our "fiche".
A fiche is a piece of paper with the most important information about a person on it: name, birthday, passport number, etc. 
Ours also contains information about our motorcycles.
We need a fiche because there are a lot of police checks in western sahara and mauretania.
If you pass one of those police checks and cannot give them a fiche, they will take your passport and copy down the information by hand, which takes forever.

We take the coastal route through Sidi Ifni and visit a giant stone arch on the way.
We also saved two turtles who were trying to cross the road, one only had 3 legs.
I like turtles.

Continuing south along the coast, the landscape becomes increasingly bare, before it turns into a vast area of emptiness.
Driving through this empty and seemingly never ending land is less boring than I expected.
It's easy to reach a meditative state while driving.
The kilometers pass quickly.
The road is straight and you can average 110km/h.
There's very little traffic, but occasionally you meet a herd of camels.
We spend most of the day driving.

The distance to the border becomes smaller and smaller.
Small towns on the way provide a place to rest and eat.
Many of them are mostly inhabited by soldiers.
The region is supported financially by the government.
You can buy everything that is available in "normal" Morocco here, for normal prices, even though it's more than a thousand kilometers away from Agadir.
We also drive by a ghost town, complete with mosque, houses and street lamps.
A prime example of all the money that has been wasted in this region.

We stop in Dakhla, the last larger settlement in Western Sahara.
Many kitesurfers stay here to take advantage of the steady wind and the large lagoon.
We reach the border post, where we will spend the night.
Spotting some kids playing on the street, we take a closer look at the old Mercedes Sprinter 208 (iirc).
They're Austrian! A family with four kids traveling together, great.
They are coming from Mauritania and give us tons of valuable information.
We spent the whole evening in their car, talking about many things.
A fun night before we cross the border tomorrow.
It's going to be an expensive day, this much we know.
