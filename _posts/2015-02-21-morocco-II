We arrive in Chefchaouen, where we meet Machmut,
one of the few couchsurfing hosts in Morocco.
Together, we walk through the Medina.
Many Moroccan cities have a Medina.
This area inside the city is often surrounded by a city wall, mostly pedestrian zone and consists of a labyrinth of twisting alleys.
Along these alleys are old houses, one never quite like the other and yet they look alike enough to get you lost.
In Chefchaouen, many houses in the Medina are painted blue, which gives it an usual atmosphere.

The next day we visit a local hammam.
In Arabic, hammam means bath(TODO CHECK).
In modern times the word's meaning has been stretched to include more than just your normal hammam:
There's hammams which are more like western spa hotels, where you can go to relax and get massages, provided your wallet is thick enough.
At the other end of the spectrum is the local hammam, where people go to clean themselves and relax.
Your wallet doesn't need to be thick for this type of hammam: the entrance fee is around one euro.
During the day, women can go and at night it's open for men.
People come here for different reasons, some don't have a shower at home, others because it's warm and some to relax and socialize.
The hammam we are going to is separated into three rooms.
In the first room, we change and deposit our clothes.
Everyone wears either underwear or some swim pants, so we do that too.
The guy at the counter gives each of us two big plastic buckets.
We grab our shampoo and the small bucket/cup we brought and put them in the big buckets.
With our equipment ready, we head into the next room.
The temperature noticeably went up 10 degrees.
There's a cold water "well", two sinks with mirrors to the right and empty space to the left.
Moving on to the next room, the temperature increased even more.
The steam from all the hot water and the lack of light give the whole place a unique feel.
There's a few people here, but it's not crowded.
To our right, the space was seperated in three smaller parts, but with one open side.
Similar to 3 bathroom stalls, but without the doors.
In front of us there's a hot water "well", where we fill our buckets.
In this case, "hot" means "is this going to burn my skin?"-hot.
We slowly adjust to the temperature and get to work.
Being the foreigners that we are, we have to cheat and get cold water from the second room.
Shiny and clean, we head back to Machmuts place, which is next door.

In the rainy morning, we drive to Ouezzane, a small and traditional town, where we spend a day before we head further to Moulay Idris.
Moulay Idriss is a holy city located on a hill, overlooking a beautiful green valley.
Nearby is the Volubilis, an area of ruins from the Romans, who settled here some 2000 years ago.
We stay at a family-run auberge.
A heater is provided to us, a luxury we could only dream of in the past two weeks.
Happy about the warm room and the good food prepared by the grandmother, we spend 4 nights here.
The Volubilis, Moulay Idriss, the surrounding area and our e-readers provide good entertainment.


On our way to Fez, we stop at a scenic spot to have lunch.

A farmer emerges from the field on a donkey and talks to us for a little while.
This is quite a normal thing in areas where tourists don't normally go.
He offers us beans from his field and we give him some of the bread we brought.
He says he's going to eat at his house and invites to come along.
We politely refuse, but after much polite pressuring accept an invitation for tea.
The farmer hands his donkey to his son, who is still working and rides with us to his house.
Two cows are busy eating grass on his lawn.
We go through the usual procedure of meeting the family.
They're all very friendly, but speak very little French, so we mainly communicate with hands and feet.
As time goes by we realize somebody is cooking and start wondering whether an invitation for tea means more than just tea.
So we eat eggs from the chickens we saw running around outside, bread with home-made butter, olive oil, fresh olives from their trees and beans.
Under the constant urging of the mother to eat more, our bellies fill quickly.
After the meal and tea, we have to drink coffee outside - not our favorite, but we don't want to make our hosts angry.
Overwhelmed by all the hospitality and the size of the family, we do what any good traveler would do: take a group photo.
After we give our many thanks and are forced to take some more food with us, we're finally on our way to Fez.
The friendliness and hospitality of these people is astonishing.
If you're a foreigner coming to a small village in Bavaria, people might stare at you, frown at you or ignore you.
If you're lucky, they'll greet you, but they surely won't invite you to anything.
Maybe that's something Europeans have yet to learn.
