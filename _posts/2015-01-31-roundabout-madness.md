After the first night at François' house, he takes us to a few fascinating villages in the area. Whole towns made
up of old stone houses alongside narrow cobblestone roads. He tells us
that these are full of tourists in the summer, but we're alone now -- not even
locals seem to go outside in the Winter. I would tell you the names of these
places, but I don't remember them.

In the evening we go to a small gathering with François and most of the
housemates. Fred, a friend of theirs (and now ours), invited them over.
We bring food, which is being prepared and eaten bit by bit over the course of
a few hours. It's topped off with a gallette des rois, of course.

To Germans, the French eating style takes a bit of getting used to:
you basically spend all evening eating little by little, taking breaks in
between, talking a lot and drinking different things. This whole process takes hours
and when you think it's finally over, they bring out cheese, which (of course)
has to be accompanied by a different drink than you had before.
My grandparents on the other hand finish a three course meal including a salad,
a main dish and dessert in less than 40 minutes.
Don't get me wrong, the French eating style is a very enjoyable experience,
just unusual for us.
The next day we do mostly nothing, just read and help François clean the staple
for the 8 chickens they have. One of the chickens left an egg as a reward.

We leave the next day and drive to Lunel, a city near Montpellier and spend
the night there in a cheap hotel. We also spend the next day on the road, stopping on the Mediterranean coast for a break.

Afterwards, we head up winding roads into the Pyrenees, to a town called Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans,
where Martin, our couchsurfing host welcomes us. He's 67 and has to use an
oxygen concentrator while walking up the stairs, but is mentally fit. We talk
for quite some time near the wood stove, the only warm place in the house.
The next day we use Martin's garage to fix some problems with our bikes:
Lorenz checks why his speedometer is not working, which means taking the front
wheel off and opening it up. The cause is quickly found: a small plastic part
is broken. We make a mental note to buy one in Spain and put it back together.
On my bike, the right blinker isn't always working, so I have to remove the
boxes and the seat to check the wiring. There's no obvious fault, but we
reinsulate some of the connections. Time will tell if this was the problem.
Lorenz' bike also makes strange noises in first and second gear, but we don't
really have an idea where they're coming from. They come and go, so we'll just
have to keep an eye on it, I guess. After another night at Martin's place, we
head over a curvy and very scenic road into Spain. On the way, we look at a
dolman; strange how people in the bronze age managed to arrange insanely heavy
stones into something that in some way or another resembles a house.

Passing the first gas station in Spain, we are delighted to see that gas is
around 20 cents cheaper here than it is in France.
We have to use the navigation app to reach our next destination: Cadaques.
I use an app called Nokia Here, which lets you download maps, so you don't have
to use your precious data volumne while roaming. Our German cellphone provider
offers 100MB for 7 days within the EU for 5 euros, which is okay, but I still
don't want to waste it on navigation. Normally, we just buy SIM cards, but
since we don't plan on spending too much time in Europe, it's not worth it.
The road to Cadaques is great, it's a very curvy road through a
"parque natural", which I guess is the same as a "Naturpark" in Germany.
Riding on this road in sunny weather is fun and we eat a very late
(and surprisingly cheap) lunch in Cadaques near the seaside. Lorenz asks the
waitress for an "habitacion" and she gives us directions in Spanish, talking
faster than a machine gun can shoot. We didn't understand her fully, but we
make it up by driving around aimlessly for a while until we find it.

The next day we visit the nearby Cap de Creus, also along curvy roads and in
sunny weather. The landscape is incredibly rough, similar to what you would
see in pictures sent to Earth by a Mars rover. I highly recommend everyone
who goes to the area to visit Cadaques/Cap de Creus.

We try to get out of the region by using a gravel road,
but it's not allowed for motorcycles. So we take the same curvy road back,
which is fun, too. Not too far later, we drive from Sant Feliu de Guixols
to Tossa de Mar, also a very scenic and fun road, this time along the coast.

Our target for today is Lloret de Mar,
a town most Europeans know for drinking and partying. In the
Winter, it's mostly deserted except for a few strange looking Brits. Our hotel,
which costs 12.50eur per person, is a three star hotel with spa. For 1.50eur
per person, we could have had breakfast included, but we decline the offer. A
choice that is partially regretted later, mostly by Lorenz, because he doesn't
like oats with milk and a banana for breakfast.

From Lloret, we pass Barcelona and reach Cubelles, which I will write about in
my next post.
