We leave the riverside camp at 7am, the only time of the day with bearable temperatures.
We first reach Kedougou and head over a piste to Dindefelo.

The reason we come here are the cascades.
The waterfall is stunning and well worth the trip.
It is located at the end of a narrow valley, which is nourished by the water.
The deeper you go into the valley and therefore the closer you get to the waterfall, the more jungle-like the vegetation becomes.
So while it's hot and dry outside the valley, the climate is comfortable deeper in the valley.
On our way there, we get a glimpse of chimpanzees, but they hide quickly.
It's a Sunday, so there's quite a lot of people there.
We decide to spend another day at the waterfall, where it's around 10 degrees cooler than outside the valley.
Still around 30 degrees, but we're getting used to it.
Today is a Monday, so we're alone for most of the time.
Not many tourists come to Senegal during this season and the Ebola outbreak in nearby Guinea hasn't been helping either.

On the way back, we see the chimpanzees again.
This time we're very quiet and approach slowly, but keep a safe distance.
We get to watch them for quite some time.
I count 7 of them.
They're climbing around in the trees.
The wind is not in our favor, so they must have smelled us.
Slowly but steadily they are moving away, coming down from their trees and moving deeper into the forest.
It's impossible to follow them quietly.
Each of our steps results in the noise of dried leaves and sticks being crushed, while the chimpanzees tread lightly and effortlessly along the jungle floor.
One of them stops and sits down to look at us.
They're so strangely like us.
A fascinating sight.

In the evening, we are getting dinner at the village centre.
The village has no elecricity, so all the light comes from batteries.
We bring our flashlights and walk to the center.
The road from our campement to there is stony and dusty.
There's only a few cars in this village, all of them are used as taxis or to transport goods.
We pass a solar powered street lamp with a smashed bulb.
I guess the people living next to it didn't like the light.
Or maybe it was kids.
The village center has another solar powered street lamp, this time with a bulb.

We decide against the few shops selling sandwiches and go to the spaghetti lady.
She sells fried spaghetti and fried potatoes, both rare foods to be sold here.
The sun hasn't fully set and her food is not ready either.
I tell her that we have time and she brings us a wooden bench to sit on.
We face the square.
To my left, I can see the spaghetti and potatoes cooking over a charcoal fire.
Heavy pots filled with water are positioned on a round, small stove made of wire.
Inside the stove goes the charcoal and underneath is a little metal container in which a fire can be made to light the coals.
Clever and simple.
Near the solar street lamp, people are unloading goods from one of the few small trucks in the village.
They are getting them into the various shops along the village square.
Two donkeys walk by and feed on some carton lying around.
To our right a few goats are looking for food.
A kid rides by on a bicycle way too large for him.
It's almost dark now and the people have finished unloading the truck.
A cow is walking home from a day in the woods.
The spaghetti lady is peeling and cutting potatoes.
Food must be ready soon.
I can hear the little gas stove she uses for frying turn on.
She does her magic and 2mins later I have a portion of delicious fried potatoes in front of me.
Her LED lantern is blinding me, but I'm too hungry to care.

Our next stop is a Bassari village.
The Bassari live in the area around Kedougou.
Most of them live traditionally off the land.
We first go to Etoile because it was recommended to us, but find that there's a large hotel there.
The hotel is made up of straw-roofed huts, so it doesn't stick out that much.
However, we're disappointed to find something touristic while we were looking for a traditional village.
We decide to continue to a real village and drive further on paths a car would not fit on.
The next village is much better.
One of the inhabitants studied in nearby Tambacounda and speaks French.
He offers us to stay for a while and rest.
Three chairs are pulled up under a giant mango tree.
The kids start climbing into the tree to collect some fresh mangoes.
Five minutes later, a whole bucket is filled.
We eat a few, they're very good.

Later, lunch is served: rice with peanut sauce and a traditional meal.
It's made of millet and has dough-like consistency.
When eating, the millet dough is formed into a small ball with one hand.
It's then dipped into a sauce and eaten.
We rest in the shade during the afternoon heat.
My French is not that great, but I manage to have a slow conversation with our host.
In the dry season he doesn't have much to do, so he's free to answer our questions.
I ask him why he returned from the city.
He says that in the village it's quiet and boring, which takes some getting used to, but in the city you have to pay for everything:
Want to eat? Have to pay. Want to sleep? Have to pay. Want to go to the bathroom? Have to pay.
When we show him some pictures of our journey, all the kids gather round to see them as well.
I don't think they've seen much of the outside world.
I manage to explain how snow sledding works and how to build a snowman, but explaining how snow feels seems impossible.
Dinner is some more rice with peanut sauce and a bit of very spicy chili powder.
We sleep in our tent under the mango tree.

The next morning, we head back to Kedougou.
On the way we want to look at Ewol, a village with a giant Baobab.
It takes us a while to find the right path.
The main road here is a piste and the path to Ewol is barely wide enough to fit a car.
As the path gets stonier and steeper, we decide to leave the motorcycles here and continue on foot.
They are too heavy for this kind of path.
We hide our motorcycle clothes in the bushes.
After fifteen minutes of walking through blistering heat, we reach a rather large village.
There must be around 500 people living on top of this hill.
At one end of the village is a well and behind it Ewol, the giant baobab.

Back in Kedougou, we get some rest and I do an oil change on my bike.
Driving every day in this heat is exhausting.
The road ahead won't get easier, too.
We leave Kedougou at 6:30am for Mali.
The road to the border is good and we reach it quickly.
The ebola prevention consists of a quick temperature check and washing our hands with chlorinated water.
Very useful.
Once we're in Mali, we have some problems finding the way.
We don't have a map and the offline maps on my phone are not very helpful either.
The locals recommend a route which seems like a big detour, but after seeing that all the others are pistes, we take it.
After 350km on tarmac (since Kedougou) and 100km on piste, we finally reach Cool Camp, Manantali.
More kilometers than we ever drove in one day.
The only thing that kept us going in the end was the vision of a cool bath.
The camp is run by a Dutch guy.
It's like a little paradise and a well needed shelter from the heat.
There's a lot plants and trees.
The mango trees have tons of ripe fruit hanging from them.
What makes this camp really great is the river: the water is cool and clean and you can just jump in from the riverbank.
Which we do.
