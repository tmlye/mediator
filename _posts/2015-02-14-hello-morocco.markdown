The ferry from Mortil (Spain) to Melilla (Spain) took around 5 hours and was mostly empty. We spend one night in Melilla and cross the border to Morocco on the next day. The border here is unusual in that Melilla is surrounded by Moroccan land and the EU WRITE ABOUT FENCE. We head there around noon. The whole process takes around three hours and is largely unorganized and inefficient. Maybe I will write about it in a separate post. With our patience well tested by bureaucracy, we head into Morocco and immediately out of the border area into the nearby mountains from which we have a nice view over the area. The fence is clearly visible, even from up here. As we go further up the mountain, we pass by a group of people which flee into the forest as they see us coming. They are obviously hiding up here, waiting for a chance to cross over into that tiny walled-in spot of Europe on the African continent, hoping for a better future and demanding nothing of us except that we give them a chance. Unfortunately, that chance is not mine to give, so I ignore the sadness and keep on driving up the curvy road.

We take a break to drink some mint tea and continue to Ben Taieb, a small town where we buy Moroccan SIM-Cards. We ask the owner of the shop if there's a hotel in town and he calls his brother, Fouad, who speaks English and some German. He says there is only one hotel in town and it's better to stay in an apartment. We still ask to see the hotel and decide that he's probably right. It's common in smaller towns to rent out your apartment to travelers for a night or two. On the way there, he offers us to stay at his apartment for free. We think his brother and him are trustworthy and accept. After a generous dinner cooked by their mother and a good night's sleep, we head to Al Hoceima, where we spend 3 nights in a hotel. The price is 10eur per person per night. Not the cheapest you can get, but we were tired of searching. Over the next few days, we explore the town and the nearby national park.

The national park provides stunning views and green valleys in which the cherry trees are already flowering. It feels a lot like spring, except that it's the beginning of February.

We leave Al Hoceima behind and head to Chefchouaen through the Rif Mountains, an area that is famous for being the world's largest producer of Marihuana. The people say that even the soil here is addicted to it, meaning that it doesn't grow anything else. It's not quite true of course and the markets we pass by, filled with fresh fruits and vegetables, prove it. The whole way to Chefchouaen is beautiful and we record a lot of videos, which I, unfortunately, cannot upload over mobile internet. I will publish them in a separate post soon (I hope).
