We stay at Cool Camp Manantali for 3 days.
The river is nice and the nearby town provides us with everything we need.
On the second day we take the boat for a spin.
It's a strange mode of transportation and the rowing takes some getting used to.
Many people greet us while going down the river.
They must find it funny that two toubabo ("white man") are going down the river and up again without any purpose.
Many of these villages seem to be only reachable by boat.
At least they rely heavily on boats for transporting people and goods to nearby Manantali.


We continue to Bamako and spend the first night in the city center.
The hotel is noisy, shabby and it's difficult to find food.
We definitely don't want to stay there.
So we pick up our passports which we dropped off at the embassy of Burkina Faso the day before.
Our next stop is the Malian office where we can get the real visa "printed" into our passports.
It's just down the road from the embassy of Burkina.
At the border to Mali, we only got a temporary visa, which we now have to convert into a real one.
Tomorrow is a holiday and after we tell the lady we can't wait until Monday, she tells us she will have it ready at 3 o'clock.
Great.

Online, we find a nice place to stay which is still affordable for us: Campement Kangaba.
They have 3 pools and a really nice environment.
A good place for spending a day relaxing, especially in 40 degree weather.
