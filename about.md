A friend and I drove from Nuremberg, Germany to Mali on our motorcycles.
We spent some time in Morocco, before we headed further down through Mauretania, Senegal and on to Mali. The original plan was to go further to Burkina Faso, but my friend had an accident (wasn't his fault), so we came back earlier.
